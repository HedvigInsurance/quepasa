## API

- `setupTrackers<TEvents>(segment: SegmentAnalyticsJs): { Track, TrackAction, Identify }`

Creates trackers with the provided `SegmentAnalyticsJs`-instance. You may provide an enum `TEvents`,
in which case the created components will only accept events in that enum, or any of the `SemanticEvents`.

- `<Track event={Event | EventCreator} />`

Tracks the provided event when mounted. You can provide event as a literal object or a function.
If a function is provided, the function will be called to construct the event when tracking should occur.

- `<TrackAction event={Event |Â EventCreator}>{(track: (event) => void) => children}</TrackAction>`

Provides a function `track` as a render prop, which you may then call to perform the desired track

- `<Identify identity={Identity | IdentityCreator} />`

Sets the identity for the current user when mounted.

- SemanticEvents

Object of enums of all the semantic events, provided for convenience. These are by default accepted
as event names for components that track events.
